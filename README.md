## **Why "project"?**

Because that's exactly what it is; it is an undertaking that is difficult and requires effort but is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim or goal. A project can be temporary in that it **_may_** have a defined beginning and end in time, but regardless **_must_** have an initially defined scope and set of resources with respect to the forseeable future.

## **Why "blue"?**

In the securities market, and to some extent more broadly in finance, the colors green and red are typically used to express respectivaly a increase or decrease in value over a given time period. Perhaps coincidentally, these two colors, along with the color blue, form the popular RGB Color Model. Since the focus of this project is **_NOT_** to predict whether the price of a security will increase or decrease,the two colors, green and red, do not matter in the context of the final result. Therefore, blue is chosen by both a) process of elimination in the RGB color model as well as b) to dismiss the regard of periodic returns as a sole basis for quantifying the investability of a security.

## **Why "is"?**

Pronounced like "eyes", the "is" is shorthand for multiple (two) I's. The expanded version of the I's is what we're out to build and that is an Investability Index. The Investability Index will set out to use hard-set math and statistics to quantify the probability of a security outperforming it's benchmark (index). In other words, we're trying to pick the winners/outperformers of a benchmark such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, or the NASDAQ. While this is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination, the thought of achieving such a feat through the use of currently undeveloped math introduces a great prospect.
