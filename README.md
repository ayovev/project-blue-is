## **Why "project"?**

Because that's exactly what it is; it is an undertaking that is difficult and requires effort but is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim or goal.

#### THINK ABOUT THIS (AND REVISE)
//
A project can be temporary in that it **_may_** have a defined beginning and end in time, but regardless **_must_** have a defined scope and set of resources with respect to the forseeable future.

## **Why "blue"?**

In the securities market, and to some extent more broadly in finance, the colors green and red are typically used to express respectivaly a increase or decrease in value over a given time period. Perhaps coincidentally, these two colors, along with the color blue, form the popular RGB Color Model. Since the focus of this project is **_NOT_** to predict whether the price of a security will increase or decrease,the two colors, green and red, do not matter in the context of the final result. Therefore, blue is chosen by both a) process of elimination in the RGB color model as well as b) to dismiss the regard of periodic returns as a sole basis for quantifying the investability of a security.

## **Why "is"?**

Pronounced like "eyes", the "is" is shorthand for multiple (two) I's. The expanded version of the I's is what we're out to build and that is an Investability Index. The construction of this Investability Index is based on the theory of "factor investing" with the exception that instead of using it to construct a portfolio based on choosing securities on attributes, or "factors", that are associated with higher returns, we are using these factors to accurately rank the probability of a given security achieving a rate of return in excess of a benchmark.


#### THINK ABOUT THIS (AND REVISE)
//
The construction of this index will utilize the theory of factor-based investing which targets quantifiable firm characteristics or “factors” that can explain differences in stock returns.

A factor-based investment strategy involves tilting equity portfolios towards and away from specific factors in an attempt to generate long-term investment returns in excess of benchmarks. The approach is quantitative and based on observable data, such as stock prices and financial information, rather than on opinion or speculation.

Security characteristics that may be included in a factor-based approach includes size, value, momentum, asset growth, profitability and leverage.
